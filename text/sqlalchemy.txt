SQLAlchemy

============

Foreign Key and backref
-----------------------

A foreign key can be defined in the following way:

```
some_id = Column(
    Integer,
    ForeignKey("other_table.id"),
    nullable=False,
    comment="Foreign key to other_table",
)
other_table = relationship(other_table, backref="some_ids")
```

This is like the sub-table of a parent table.   The some_id column has
integer values that must be present in the other_table.id column.
A variable called other_table references the parent record in other_table
and the backref 'some_ids' seems to add a property onto other_table called
some_ids that contains all of the records from this table associated with the
parent record in the 'other_table' table.

Notes about backref and back_populates:
---------------------------------------

backref - uses a bi-directional back_populates configuration and is referenced
    as legacy within the docs.   They indicate that back_populates is prefered.
back_populates - This allows objects on both sides of each relationship() to
    synchronize in-Python state changes.

back_populates
--------------

To use back_populates, you might see something like this:


On the parent table, you would have something like this:
```
sub_table_variable = relationship("SubTable", back_populates="parent_table_variable", lazy=True)
```


You would then access 


On the sub-table, you would have something like this:
```
parent_table_variable = relationship("ParentTable", back_populates="sub_table_variable", lazy=True)
```
You would also add a foreign key onto the sub-table


lazy = ‘select’, 'joined' or 'subquery' (or True):
    Allows you to access properties using something like this:
    ```
    session.query(SomeTable).first().subrecords
    ```
    The select, joined and subquery arguments specify how the records are retrieved

lazy = ‘dynamic’ (or False)
    Returns a query object that you can filter more.   You would need to use
    something like this:
    ```
    session.query(SomeTable).first().subrecords.all()
    ```

Common Functions when Querying
-----------------------
.one()          - one row or raise an exception
.one_or_none()  - return at most one row or None.
.scalar()       - first element of first result or None
.scalars()      - I believe it is first element of each result or None (ie multi-row)
.scalar_one()   - produce one scalar result or an exception (sames as .scalars().one())
.all()          - I believe it fetches all rows in one go.
.first()        - first row or None.

.fetchall(), .fetchone(), .fetchmany() etc are for backward compatibility with old versions.

Common Functions when Querying
-----------------------

.join(some_table, isouter=True)         - left outer join
.join(some_table, full=True)            - full outer join

SQLAlchemy doesn't have a right join, instead reverse the order of the joins and do a left join.
