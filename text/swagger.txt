Swagger/OpenAPI
===============

  There is a swagger editor which is handy for copying yaml into and checking the
  format is correct.

  https://editor.swagger.io

  I have installed the OpenAPI (swagger) extension on VSCode.   When editing a
  swagger doc, you can click the API on the left and navigate the doc using
  things like paths etc.
  It has intellisence and if you click on the small window shaped icon, with
  a small circle in the bottom right, at the top of VSCode, you can preview
  the swagger doc.

  A really interesting feature is that you can download example code by
  selecting the drop down 'Generate Server' and then selecting flask-api.
  There is also a menu for 'front end code'.

  OpenAPI spec can be found here
  https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md#schema

  IN PARTICULAR, openapi, info and paths ARE REQUIRED.

Typical Doc
-----------

  If you find an example online, you can see how openapi and info used to provide basic
  information.   It might be worth noting that you can pass in variables and use them
  like jinja {{varname}}.

  With respect to paths, you typically have a path such as /names: followed by a type
  such as get: post: etc.

  The responses section is quite important as id describes what the response will look
  like if you get a 200 code etc.   A typical responses section will like like this:

  responses:
    200:
      description: This is way this does
      content:
        application/json:                   # RETURN TYPE FOR 200
          schema:
            type: array                     # RETURN TYPE
            items:
              properties:
                id:
                  type: integer   etc

  IT IS VERY USEFUL TO USE AUTOCOMPLETE WHEN WRITTING SWAGGER DOCS.   WITHIN VSCODE
  TRY ctrl+space OR ctrl+shift+space

tags
----

  Useful for positioning endpoints within the swagger page.   You add a description
  of a set of tags at the top of the document, eg:

  openapi: "3.0.0"
  info:
    version: "1.0"
    title: My API description
  tags:
    - name: Article
    - description: A description of Article

  You then add these tags to a particular path, eg:

  paths:
    /:
      get:
        tags:
          - Article

Arrays and Objects (Dictionaries)
---------------------------------

Typically these take the following format:

  # EXAMPLE DICTIONARY                              # EXAMPLE Arrays

  schema:                                           schema:
    type: object                                      type: array
    properties:                                       items:
      name:                                             type: integer
        type: string                                    format: int64
        example: "William"
      age:
        type: integer
        example: 15

Parameters
----------

When defining an api, you quite often get parameters in the following
format:

/someurl/{input_param_1}

These are defined in the following way:

  /someurl/{intput_id}
    get:
      ...
      parameters:
        - in: query
        name: first_name
        schema:
          type: string
          example: bob

  -in: can have the values "query", "header", "path" or "cookie"
       to understand query vs path, consider this:

       /cars/honda/civic/coupe/{vin}?colour={black}

       A car's vin generally doesn't change, but its colour can change.
       path = resource identification, query params = resource filter/sort.

Components
----------

Within the swagger/openapi document you define (typically at bottom) a
components area where you can define re=usable schemas or parameters
that can be used within the document.   These schemas can also contain
schema definitions so you can get interdpendency.

  coponents:
    schemas:
      MySchema:
        properties:
          success:
            type: boolean
            example: true
          version:
            type: string
            example: v1
    ...
    parameters:
      my_parameter:
        name: my_parameter
        in: path
        description: "my parameter as integer"
        required: true
        schema:
          type: integer
    ...

This schema would then be used within the doc in the following way:

  responses:
    "200":
      description: "success if api works"
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/MySchema"

OR for a parameter:

  parameters:
    - $ref: "#/components/parameters/my_parameter"

Content Negotiation
-------------------

You can have multiple content types within the swagger doc and the ui
should return the appropriate display, for example:

  content:
    application/json:
      ...
    application/xml:
      ...

Post/Put etc
------------

A typical post/put definition will look like this:

  post:
    tags:
      - Article
    requestBody:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref.....
    responses:
      "200":
      ....
