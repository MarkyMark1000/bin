PYREVERSE
=========

- Can automatically draw uml diagrams from your python code.
- Might need to have graphviz installed and possibly javascript for more advanced features,
  such as drawing images.
- need to install pylint: `pip install pylint`
- change the -o argument to specify the output format:
  -o mmd (mermaid)   -o html (mermaid) -o puml (plantuml) -o dot (graphviz readable file)
  -o png -o svg -o pdf (image files, need graphviz installed)
- can filter what is displayed using -f:
  - PUB_ONLY (public only, default)
  - ALL (all)
  - SPECIAL (filter python special functions)
  - OTHER (filter private and protected attributes)
- might want to connect to a docker image, but map to a different port, then install pylint.
- Example commands I like:
    pyreverse -class=<class>                       [diagrams for classes related to class]
    pyreverse -m                                   [include module name in class]
    pyreverse --only-classnames
    pyreverse -f ALL -ASmy --colorized -o png -p myproj *.py   [detailed image]
    pyreverse -ASmy --colorized -o png -p myproj *.py   [simpler image, less detail]
- A good way to explore might be to use something like this and then increase inheritance depth (-a)
  and associations (-s) to understand the structure.   Then move into specific directories to understand
  the structure:
    pyrevers -my -a0 -s0 --colorized -o png -p myproj *.py
    

MERMAID
=======

- Easy in VSCode, add the 'Markdown Preview Mermaid' Extension.
- Can use your mermaid diagrams in your markdown files (.md files).
- They are then visible in github.
- can be generated by pyreverse.
- Create a .md file, then use 3 right tick-quotes, the word mermaid, the chart content,   
  then close with 3 left tick-quotes
- https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html
- There is a live online editor on the mermaid website which can be useful.
- On the live editor you can same images as png etc.
- Arjan codes mainly uses this, great for simple things.
- Quite a few chart types, like look of 'Class Diagram', 'C4 Diagram', 'Pie Chart', 'XY Chart',   
  'GitGraph', 'TimeLine', 'Kanban', 'MindMap', but more...

PLANTUML
=======

- Integrates with vscode, but is more difficult.   Need to install graphviz, maybe java
  or you send your structure to an external server, which draws the image and returns it.
- Install 'PlantUML' extension for VSCode.
- Can be included in an md file:
    - 3 backticks, immediately followed by plantuml
    - @startuml on the next line
    - then the uml diagram content
    - @enduml on the 2nd from last line
    - close with three backticks.
- There are lots of examples on the website, but unfortunately lots of adds, but you can
  copy some into the previosly mentioned code.
- To setup with external server:
    - goto code -> settings -> settings, and search for 'plantuml'
    - need to change 'plantuml: Render' so that it uses the server.
    - need to add the server (visible in settings) to 'plantuml: Server'
- You then render the .md file containing the uml code and it should render, but will obviously
  have problems if you have no internet connection.
- It also seems stuck in a white background and isn't easy to select text in the image.
- I tend to deactivate it so that I don't send work stuff to an external server.

HACKERDRAW
==========

- Website only, hackerdraw.com
- Need to signup, but account is free for individuals.
- Nice and easy to draw boxes, arrows, move them around and format them.
- Likes entity relationship diagram tool here as format is easier to understand with less
  weird arrow syntax.
- Could be good for sketching out an initial database plan before it is created.

DBBEAVER
========

- I prefer this for generating erd diagrams from postgre because it adds all of the lines automatically.
- It's fairly easy to remove tables, but I haven't tried adding them yet.
- It can export erd as some image files and an '.erd' file, but i'm not sure what can import that yet.
