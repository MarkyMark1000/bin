Preview (Markup)
================

Within the preview app there are basic image editing features.   Show the Markup
toolbar by selecting the icon 'Show Markup Toolbar'.

I found moving stuff hard.   Select the shape, but it and then paste it somewhere
else.   Select a bit of background, copy it and patch up the hole.

Change background color: Preview -> Preferences -> General

Smart Lasso: selecting bits of complex shapes

Use shift if you want to select a square, then tools -> crop.

Tools -> flip horizontal or flip vertical
