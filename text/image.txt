Preview (Markup)
================

Within the preview app there are basic image editing features.   Show the Markup
toolbar by selecting the icon 'Show Markup Toolbar'.

I found moving stuff hard.   Select the shape, but it and then paste it somewhere
else.   Select a bit of background, copy it and patch up the hole.

Change background color: Preview -> Preferences -> General

Smart Lasso: selecting bits of complex shapes

Use shift if you want to select a square, then tools -> crop.

Tools -> flip horizontal or flip vertical

GIMP
====

Gimp has free tutorials on the basics here:
https://www.gimp.org/tutorials/

GIMP Quickies:

image -> scale image            changes size of image which can be seen in top bar of gimp.
                                the chain locks the aspect ratio.

file -> export                  save or overwrite the image.
file -> overwrite

tools -> transform -> crop      also a tool for croping image.    Use esc to cancel or enter to crop.
                                found it quirky.   Save/Export image if having trouble.

tools -> selection tools ->     tool for selecting shapes.   Can add things like rounded corners. and
rectangle select, then          then crop the image.
image -> crop to selection

tools -> transform -> rotate    also a tool for rotating.   Fairly intuitive.

Simple Floating Logo:

file -> new                     create new image with specific size.

There are two squares on the left set of tools with a foreground and background colour.   Change the
foreground colour to black.

tools -> paint tools ->         or use the bucket fill tool icon.   There are lots of options here.
bucket fill

tools -> text                   add text or can use icon on the left.   You need to change the foreground
                                colour or swap the foreground/background colour.
                                On the right hand side there are things where you can select the font and
                                the layer that you are currently working on.

Layer -> new from visible       creates a new layer from all visible layers.

filters -> blur ->              applies a blur effect to the merged image layer.
gaussian blur
