CODE QUALITY
------------

Very Useful:

 Black		[automatically formats code]
 Isort		[automaticallu formats inputs]

Linters:

 Flake8		[pyflakes, pycodestyle, mccabe]
 PyLama		[pycodestyle, pydocstyle, pyflakes, mccabe,..]

Single Apps:

 pycodestyle	--max-line-length=88
 easy to install and use.   88 makes it consistent with black.

 pydocstyle
 very easy to install and use

 mccabe
 extension of flake8, good for ensuring code complexity is not too high.

 radon
 radon cc .		[cyc complexity of . and below]
 radon cc . --min C	[min complexity of C]
 radon raw .		[LOC (lines of code), Comments (no comments etc]
 radon mi .		[maintainability index, A good ... ]
 radon mi . --min D	[min of D]
 radon hal .		[halstead .. not sure]
 
 pylint
 not sure yet, but useful pyreverse

   pyreverse
   part of pylint and can draw UML diagrams, see pyreverse -h
   
   I have some of these that I have tried out and need to fill in.

 pyflakes
 not sure yet

 bandit
 check for security vulnerabilities

 mypy
 checks for optionally enforced static types

   I have tried this and need to practice more.   You get lots of junk mixed
   with useful hints about types being allocated incorrectly.

 snakefood
 build UML diagrams, couldn't get it working yet
